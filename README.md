## How to Play

On window load the cards are shuffled and the game is ready to play. Players should left-click on a card revealing the hidden symbol. The player then clicks another card trying to find the match to the first card. If the cards do not match, the cards are flipped back over after 0.7 seconds. When all of the cards are matched a congratulation modal is presented and the player has the option to start a new game or stop playing. On the modal is displayed the score, the number of moves (two card flips is one move), and the length of time taken to finish the game. The player may also restart the game during play by clicking on the rest button to the right of the score.

## Know Bugs

The player may reveal a third card if clicked rapidly after the second car, and before the cards flip back over again.

## To Do

Additional styling will be added in a future revision. The known bugs will be addressed.
